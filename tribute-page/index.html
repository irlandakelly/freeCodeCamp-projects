        <p id="tribute-info"> Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (1906-1992) was a computer pioneer and naval officer, best known for her trailblazing contributions to computer programming, software development, and the design and implementation of programming languages. A maverick and an innovator, she enjoyed long and influential careers in the U.S. Navy and the computer industry.   </p>

          <li>
            <strong> 1906</strong> – Is born on December 9th, 1906 in New York City, New York. Her parents are Walter and Mary Murray. She has a sister Mary, who is 3 years younger than her, and a brother Roger, who is 5 years younger than her.

          <li>
            <strong> 1925 </strong> - Begins school at Vassar College in New York, studying mathemartics and physics. </li>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> 1928 </strong> - Graduates from Vassar and moves on to study at Yale University, working on a Master's degree in Mathematics. </li>
        <li>
        <strong> 1930 </strong> -  Gets a Master's degree in Mathematics. She also marries Vincent Foster Hopper and becomes Grace Hopper, a name she will keep long after their divorce in 1945.</li>
       <li> <strong> 1931 </strong> - Becomes a teacher at Vassar, where she used to go, and also keeps studying at Yale, hoping to get a Ph.D. in Mathematics.</li>

    <li><strong> 1943 </strong> - World War II compels Grace into joining the US Naval Reserve,. She opts for the Navy, as it was her grandfather's branch of service. </li>
        <li><strong> 1944 </strong> - She is commissioned as lieutenant in 1944, and given her mathematical background, she is assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Project at Harvard, where she learns to program a Mark I computer.</li>
        <li><strong> 1952 </strong> - In 1952, her team creates the first compiler for computer languages (a compiler renders worded instructions into code that can be read by computers).</li>
        <li><strong> 1967 </strong> - Retired from the Naval Reserve in 1966, but her pioneering computer work meant that she was recalled to active duty—at the age of 60—to tackle standardizing communication between different computer languages. She would remain with the Navy for 19 years. When she retired in 1986, at age 79, she was a rear admiral as well as the oldest serving officer in the service.</li>
        <li><strong> 1987 </strong> - Saying that she would be "bored stiff" if she stopped working entirely, Hopper took another job post-retirement and stayed in the computer industry for several more years. She was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1991—becoming the first female individual recipient of the honor.</li>
        <li><strong> 1992 </strong> - At the age of 85, she died in Arlington, Virginia, on January 1, 1992. She was laid to rest in the Arlington National Cemetery.</li>
