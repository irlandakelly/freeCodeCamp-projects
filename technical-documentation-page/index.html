                    HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data
                    exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the
                    recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different
                    sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an
                    application layer protocol that is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any
                    reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not
                    only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with
                    HTML
                    form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.

                <h3>HTTP is simple</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP is generally designed to be simple and human readable, even with the added complexity
                    introduced in
                    HTTP/2 by encapsulating HTTP messages into frames. HTTP messages can be read and understood by
                    humans,
                    providing easier testing for developers, and reduced complexity for newcomers.
                </p>
                <h3>HTTP is extensible</h3>
                <p>
                    Introduced in HTTP/1.0, HTTP headers make this protocol easy to extend and experiment with. New
                    functionality can even be introduced by a simple agreement between a client and a server about a new
                    header's semantics.
                </p>
                <h3>HTTP is is stateless, but not sessionless</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same
                    connection. This immediately has the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact
                    with
                    certain pages coherently, for example, using e-commerce shopping baskets. But while the core of HTTP
                    itself is stateless, HTTP cookies allow the use of stateful sessions. Using header extensibility,
                    HTTP
                    Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each HTTP request to share the same
                    context, or the same state.

                    When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or an intermediate proxy,
                    it
                    performs the following steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Open a TCP connection: The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an
                        answer. The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP
                        connections to the servers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these
                        simple
                        messages are encapsulated in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle
                        remains the same. For example:
                        <br><br>
                        <code class="code_block">
                        GET / HTTP/1.1<br>
                        Host: developer.mozilla.org<br>
                        Accept-Language: fr<br>
                    </code>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read the response sent by the server, such as:
                        <br><br>
                        <code class="code_block">
                        HTTP/1.1 200 OK

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Close or reuse the connection for further requests.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without waiting for the first response
                    to
                    be fully received. HTTP pipelining has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old
                    pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has been superseded in HTTP/2 with
                    more
                    robust multiplexing requests within a frame.

                <p>
                    HTTP messages, as defined in HTTP/1.1 and earlier, are human-readable. In HTTP/2, these messages are
                    embedded into a binary structure, a frame, allowing optimizations like compression of headers and
                    multiplexing. Even if only part of the original HTTP message is sent in this version of HTTP, the
                    semantics of each message is unchanged and the client reconstitutes (virtually) the original
                    HTTP/1.1
                    request. It is therefore useful to comprehend HTTP/2 messages in the HTTP/1.1 format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format.
                </p>
                <h3>Requests</h3>
                <p>
                    Requests consist of the following elements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An HTTP method, usually a verb like <code class="code_line">GET</code>, <code
                            class="code_line">POST</code>, or a noun like
                        <code class="code_line">OPTIONS</code> or <code class="code_line">HEAD</code> that defines the
                        operation the client wants to perform. Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using
                        <code class="code_line">GET</code>) or
                        post the value of an HTML form (using <code class="code_line">POST</code>), though more
                        operations may be
                        needed in other cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are
                        obvious
                        from the context, for example without the protocol (<code
                            class="code_line"></code>http://</code>), the domain (here,
                        <code class="code_line">developer.mozilla.org</code>), or the TCP port (here, <code
                            class="code_line">80</code>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The version of the HTTP protocol.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optional headers that convey additional information for the servers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A body, for some methods like <code>POST</code>, similar to those in responses, which contain
                        the
                        resource sent.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Responses</h3>
                <p>
                    Responses consist of the following elements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The version of the HTTP protocol they follow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A status code, indicating if the request was successful or not, and why.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A status message, a non-authoritative short description of the status code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HTTP headers, like those for requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optionally, a body containing the fetched resource.

                    HTTP is an extensible protocol that is easy to use. The client-server structure, combined with the
                    ability to add headers, allows HTTP to advance along with the extended capabilities of the Web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though HTTP/2 adds some complexity by embedding HTTP messages in frames to improve performance, the
                    basic structure of messages has stayed the same since HTTP/1.0. Session flow remains simple,
                    allowing it
                    to be investigated and debugged with a simple HTTP message monitor
