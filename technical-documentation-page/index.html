                HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data
                exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the
                recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different
                sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an
                application layer protocol that is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any
                reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not
                only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML
                form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.

            <h3>HTTP is simple</h3>
            <p>
                HTTP is generally designed to be simple and human readable, even with the added complexity introduced in
                HTTP/2 by encapsulating HTTP messages into frames. HTTP messages can be read and understood by humans,
                providing easier testing for developers, and reduced complexity for newcomers.
            </p>
            <h3>HTTP is extensible</h3>
            <p>
                Introduced in HTTP/1.0, HTTP headers make this protocol easy to extend and experiment with. New
                functionality can even be introduced by a simple agreement between a client and a server about a new
                header's semantics.
            </p>
            <h3>HTTP is is stateless, but not sessionless</h3>
            <p>
                HTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same
                connection. This immediately has the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact with
                certain pages coherently, for example, using e-commerce shopping baskets. But while the core of HTTP
                itself is stateless, HTTP cookies allow the use of stateful sessions. Using header extensibility, HTTP
                Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each HTTP request to share the same
                context, or the same state.
            </p>

            <p>
                When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or an intermediate proxy, it
                performs the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Open a TCP connection: The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an
                    answer. The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP
                    connections to the servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Send an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these simple
                    messages are encapsulated in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle
                    remains the same. For example:
                    <br><br>
                    <code>
                        GET / HTTP/1.1<br>
                        Host: developer.mozilla.org<br>
                        Accept-Language: fr<br>
                    </code>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read the response sent by the server, such as:
                    <br><br>
                    <code>
                        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                        <br>Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:28:02 GMT

                </li>
                <li>
                    Close or reuse the connection for further requests.

            </ol>
            <p>
                If HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without waiting for the first response to
                be fully received. HTTP pipelining has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old
                pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has been superseded in HTTP/2 with more
                robust multiplexing requests within a frame.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="http_messages">
            <header>HTTP Messages</header>
            <p>
                HTTP messages, as defined in HTTP/1.1 and earlier, are human-readable. In HTTP/2, these messages are
                embedded into a binary structure, a frame, allowing optimizations like compression of headers and
                multiplexing. Even if only part of the original HTTP message is sent in this version of HTTP, the
                semantics of each message is unchanged and the client reconstitutes (virtually) the original HTTP/1.1
                request. It is therefore useful to comprehend HTTP/2 messages in the HTTP/1.1 format.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format.
            </p>
            <h3>Requests</h3>
            <p>
                Requests consist of the following elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An HTTP method, usually a verb like <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, or a noun like
                    <code>OPTIONS</code> or <code>HEAD</code> that defines the
                    operation the client wants to perform. Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using
                    <code>GET</code>) or
                    post the value of an HTML form (using <code>POST</code>), though more operations may be
                    needed in other cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious
                    from the context, for example without the protocol (http://</code>), the domain (here,
                    <code>developer.mozilla.org</code>), or the TCP port (here, <code>80</code>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The version of the HTTP protocol.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optional headers that convey additional information for the servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A body, for some methods like <code>POST</code>, similar to those in responses, which contain the
                    resource sent.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Responses</h3>
            <p>
                Responses consist of the following elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The version of the HTTP protocol they follow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A status code, indicating if the request was successful or not, and why.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A status message, a non-authoritative short description of the status code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTTP headers, like those for requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optionally, a body containing the fetched resource.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                HTTP is an extensible protocol that is easy to use. The client-server structure, combined with the
                ability to add headers, allows HTTP to advance along with the extended capabilities of the Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though HTTP/2 adds some complexity by embedding HTTP messages in frames to improve performance, the
                basic structure of messages has stayed the same since HTTP/1.0. Session flow remains simple, allowing it
                to be investigated and debugged with a simple HTTP message monitor
